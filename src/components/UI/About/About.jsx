        <p>
          From my early days of writing simple programs to now <span className="highlighted-text">leading the development of complex eCommerce solutions</span>,
          my journey has been all about curiosity and constant learning. With <span className="highlighted-text">5 years</span> of experience in <span className="highlighted-text">WordPress & WooCommerce</span>,
          Iâ€™m dedicated to building websites and stores that donâ€™t just workâ€”they help my clientsâ€™ businesses shine.
        </p>

        <p>
          I love <span className="highlighted-text">mentoring junior developers</span>, sharing what Iâ€™ve learned, and keeping communication with clients smooth and easy every step of the way.
          Together, <span className="highlighted-text">we create something amazing every time!</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, <span className="highlighted-text">my curiosity has led me to the world of React.</span> Iâ€™m passionate about building dynamic, modern web applications and excited to dive into this powerful framework to take my development skills to the next level. ðŸš€
        </p>

        <p>
          If we step away from the code, youâ€™ll probably find me with my nose in a <span className="highlighted-text">good book</span>, immersed in a <span className="highlighted-text">game</span>,
          or <span className="highlighted-text">binge-watching movies & TV series</span>. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in <span className="highlighted-text">meditation</span>,
          <span className="highlighted-text">psychedelics</span>, <span className="highlighted-text">enlightenment</span>, and the <span className="highlighted-text">fascinating journey of evolution. ðŸŒŒ</span>
